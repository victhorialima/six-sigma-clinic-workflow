# six-sigma-clinic-workflow
Six Sigma DMAIC project to reduce wait times and improve clinic workflows.
A real-world Six Sigma project focused on improving patient flow, reducing wait times, and optimizing clinic operations using the DMAIC methodology.

## Project Goal

To analyze clinic workflows and eliminate bottlenecks, leading to faster patient service, better resource use, and improved inventory control.

## Methodology: DMAIC

- **Define:** Identified long patient wait times and inefficient inventory use as key issues. Developed a project charter with defined metrics and timeline.
- **Measure:** Mapped current workflows. Collected data on wait times, resource usage, and inventory levels to establish a performance baseline.
- **Analyze:** Used root cause analysis, process mapping, and cost-benefit analysis to locate inefficiencies and bottlenecks.
- **Improve:** Implemented scheduling changes, streamlined prescription workflow, and optimized stock levels with the inventory team.
- **Control:** Standardized new procedures and created tracking systems to monitor clinic performance and ensure sustainability.

## Key Results

- Reduced average patient wait time
- Improved prescription handling accuracy
- Minimized billing errors
- Optimized inventory levels
- Enhanced staff communication and workflow coordination

## Tools Used

- Process Mapping
- Pareto Analysis
- Control Charts
- Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Excel (for data tracking and visualization)
